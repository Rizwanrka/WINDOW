        <h3>Lucknow is the historical city.</h3>
        <p> The state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts.This unique tolerance between religions is a key feature of Lucknow, whose population today is 70% Hindu and almost 30% Muslim, with small Sikh and Christian communities comprising less than 1% (in comparison, India’s national demographics are nearly 80% Hindu and 15% Muslim). In fact, Lucknow is one of India’s only major cities that has not experienced any major problems between the two communities.
        <br>

        But although Lucknow can clearly teach India lessons in tolerance, there are signs that even this historical safe space is showing serious signs of strain.
        <br>
            
        The city’s cosmopolitanism has its roots in the ruling nawabs, or princes, of the Awadh Kingdom of the 18th and 19th Centuries. Awadh, comprising what is today the central region of Uttar Pradesh, was established in 1722 under Nawab Saadat Ali Khan, having been a province of the waning Mughal Empire since the mid-16th Century. The fertile region, with its thriving agricultural economy, became one of the most prosperous of northern India. In 1775, the nawabs established their capital at Lucknow.</p>

                <p>The heart of Lucknow beats within its bustling streets, vibrant markets, and architectural wonders. Encapsulated by the timeless charm of the city, this core embodies the essence of its rich history and cultural heritage. From the majestic Bara Imambara to the graceful Rumi Gate, the heart of Lucknow pulsates with architectural marvels narrating tales of regal grandeur. The winding lanes of Hazratganj, the aromatic flavors of Awadhi cuisine, and the rhythmic echoes of Kathak dance performances in its theaters encapsulate the city's soul. It's where traditions intertwine seamlessly with modernity, where the past converges with the present, creating a symphony of sights, sounds, and flavors that resonate through the bustling heart of Lucknow.</p>

        <h3>The gateway of old Lucknow, Rumi Darwaza stands tall as a witness of the past & the present age.</h3>
        <p>Built in 1784 as part of a famine relief works project by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, the prince of the royal house of Oudh, it is one of the last great and palatial buildings constructed in the Mughal style. The complex includes several structures, including the Bhool Bhulaiya (a labyrinth) and the Asfi mosque.
       <br>
       Look at the painting again. You can see the outer gate of the complex, and the Imambara itself is out of view. To reach the imposing building, visitors have to pass through this gate and two large courtyards before reaching the central hall, which is one of the world's largest arched constructions without the support of beams or pillars.
       <br>
            
      In the painting, straight ahead, there's the Rumi Darwaza, the imposing gateway to old Lucknow. Then there's a solitary elephant and some scattered people.
